    "### introduction: With the advent of social media and IoT (internet of things), the data volume in organizations has increased rapidly in recent years. With the increased data volume to terabytes and even petabytes, more than the traditional database and analytical techniques are required. In this course, you will learn various big data technologies and how they can be used for data management and data analytics purposes to handle such massive datasets. The first half of the course will focus on big data storage technologies such as No-SQL databases and distributed file systems. The second half of the course will focus on big data computational platforms such as Hadoop map-reduce and Spark. The course will cover in-depth spark programming on a big data platform.\n",
